the technology developed by usstrongfontpbr pfont facearial stronga the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of autoinsurance this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles accordingly the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction additionally because of saving of lives the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantiallystrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongbas per the who studies and projections road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today it is projected by who that by the year NUM they will occupy the number three positions next only to heart disease and depression by introduction of this technology we are sure that this will not happen on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death in the year NUM at allstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongc this technology will therefore make all vehicles cheaper and safer not only will the cost be reduced safety which is priceless in itself will also be greatly enhancedstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongas and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted the life of the patent will be NUM years even at the current levels with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death there is a daily loss of two billion us even at the present level over a period of twenty years without any interest and without any compounding this loss works out to be NUM billion us x NUM days x NUM years  14600 billion usstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongd our technology will ensure that at least seventyfive percent of the above losses are prevented such figure works out to be more that 10000 billion us it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level as per the future projections the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase hence the figure is likely to be increase very substantially in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure furtherstrongfontpbr pfont facearial stronge at the current levels more than 12 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents even at the current rates more than NUM million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ie life of the patent when granted besides at the current levels 32 million people are injured every year in the next twenty years the number of people injured due to road accident will therefore be more than half a billionstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongf if we add to that the personal physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings are all unmeasurable in quantities presently known to human kindstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongg considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankindstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongh the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that in the very near future the use of this technology will become unavoidable it should and will become mandatory by law to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a prerequisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in futurestrongfontpbr pfont facearial strongi as described hereinabove this technology and its utility are incomparable outthought of and unheard of till date it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures in future it can and will be

as follows strongfontpbr pfont facearial strong1 in case anyall processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design offont colorredbu new vehiclesbufont and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs the cost escalation may not be more than 5 to 8 and the safety and the protection will be ten times more than the price escalation hence drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalationstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong2 in case the font colorred buexisting vehiclesbufont are modified the cost involved will be approximately 10 to 15 of the value of the vehicle but partial modifications at a lower cost which will give partial protection may also be carried out as a thumb rule the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection providedstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong3 in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protectivestrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong4 there are more than NUM billion motor vehicles in the world at present besides there are an unspecified number of nonmotorized ehiclesstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong5 almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there fromstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong6 among the motorised vehicles the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out but over all some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiencystrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong7 even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of NUM us per vehicle the conversion industry works out to be worth 300000 billion usstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong8 realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting datestrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong9 as pointed hereinabove the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to in the range of 100000 billion us per year over the next three yearsstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong10 alternatively considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition for such conversion licenses can be granted online on receipt of online payments in that case different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehiclestrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong11 in case licensing is done the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the enduser as per his circumstances and needs however piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensingstrongfontpbr pfont facearial strong12 it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend andor estimatestrongfontpbr pfont facearial colorredbstrongupsstrongbufontp br pfont facearial strong1 some of the

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and they're not all in /etc either... > Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult & > complicated as possible ;--) Yup... In this case, I had two issues. 1. I mirrored the disk to give to someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2 processor. 2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware related. Again, it's also an interesting exercise... > Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious > hassle down the line. Oh, I'm doing that too. This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit! I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise) I'm also going for a backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org . The admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...
