# **SpamSieve : Email Classification Tool**

**Overview**

SpamSieve is an Email Classification Tool designed to categorize emails efficiently using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project encompasses a range of NLP preprocessing techniques to enhance email classification accuracy. Furthermore, the classification model is built using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its effectiveness in sequential data processing tasks.
